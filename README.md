# smart-trash-bin: Arduino based smart trash bin that automatically open the lid using ultrasonic sensor and able to sort wet or dry waste inside.

## Description
An Arduino based smart trash bin that opens automatically using ultrasonic sensor and able to sort waste inside using a soil moisture sensor. Designed as a contactless solution, easy waste sorting, and the fun experience to store waste in public areas.

## Features
- Automatic lid opening via ultrasonic proximity detection
- Wet/dry waste sorting using soil moisture sensor
- Contactless and user friendly design

  ### Hardware
  - Trash bin (any size)
  - Arduino Uno
  - HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
  - Soil moisture sensor
  - Servo motor
  - Jumper wires
  - Breadboard
  - Battery power supply
 
  ## Software
  - Arduino IDE
 
  ## How it works?
  - The ultrasonic sensor detects hand within a specific distance range
  - If the ultrasonic sensor is triggered, the servo motor will open the lid automatically
  - After waste is placed inside, the soil moisture sensor is able to read its moisture level
  - Waste is then sorted into a wet or dry section based on the sensor data
